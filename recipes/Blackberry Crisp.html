        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Say goodbye to the last few days of Summer with blackberry crisp! The buttery flavors of Fall mixed with the tart berries of Summer make this dessert the perfect combination.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>For the filling</p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups fresh blackberries, rinsed and dried</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the topping</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
            <li>vanilla bean ice cream for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a deep 9” pie pan or a regular 10” pie pan with non-stick spray. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add blackberries to a large bowl. Sprinkle blackberries with sugar, flour, cornstarch, and cinnamon. Gently stir until fully combined. Let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized bowl, combine oats, flour, sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add butter cubes and quickly cut into dry ingredients with a pastry cutter or fork until butter is fully incorporated and mixture is crumbly. Do not allow butter to melt.</li>
            <li>Pour blackberry mixture into greased pie pan and spread berries evenly.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle topping mixture over berry filling. The topping mixture should only just touch the sides of the pan, allowing space for the berry filling to boil around the edges.</li>
            <li>Bake approximately 60 minutes until the topping is browned and berry filling is bubbling. A baking sheet may be placed on the rack below to catch any drippings.</li>
            <li>Serve warm or allow to cool to room temperature, topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.</li>
        </ol>
