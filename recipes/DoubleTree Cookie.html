        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The recipe for Hilton’s signature DoubleTree Cookies is out of the bag! These cookies have a chewy inside, crisp edges, and are incredibly flavorful loaded with oats, chocolate, walnuts, and a lot of butter! They are truly the best chocolate chip cookie ever.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound butter, softened (2 sticks)</li>
            <li>¾ cup + 1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 ¼ cups flour</li>
            <li>½ cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Pinch cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 ⅔ cups Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups chopped walnuts</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cream butter, sugar and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium speed for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, vanilla and lemon juice, blending with mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, then medium speed for about 2 minutes, or until light and fluffy, scraping down bowl.</li>
            <li>With mixer on low speed, add flour, oats, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, blending for about 45 seconds. Don’t overmix.</li>
            <li>Remove bowl from mixer and stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Portion dough with a scoop (about 3 tablespoons) onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper about 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Bake for 20 to 23 minutes, or until edges are golden brown and center is still soft. </li>
            <li>Remove from oven and cool on baking sheet for about 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat an 8- or 9-inch square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, brown sugar, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place half of the bittersweet chocolate and the milk in a small saucepan and place over LOW heat. Cook and stir for a minute or two and then add the butter. Continue cooking over LOW heat, stirring constantly, until the butter and chocolate have completely melted. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla.</li>
        <li>Pour the melted chocolate mixture into the flour mixture in the mixing bowl and stir until slightly combined. Add the eggs, remaining bittersweet chocolate, and 1/4 cup of the walnuts (reserve remaining nuts for later) to the flour mixture; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into prepared baking dish and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup walnuts.</li>
        <li>Bake until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs clinging, approximately 20 to 22 minutes for 9-inch baking dish or 22 to 26 minutes for a 8-inch baking dish. The edges should seem solid but the center will appear somewhat soft and will continue to set up as the brownies cool. Ovens can vary so I recommend setting your kitchen timer for a couple of minutes shy of the recommended baking times and watching them closely towards the end. Remove from the oven and cool completely in the baking dish before cutting and serving.</li>
